MARKETSCAR SECURITY GUIDELINES
==============================

1. Private key policy:
   - Private keys MUST NOT be committed to the repository.
   - For CI and production, store keys as GitHub Actions Secrets named:
     - DEV_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH (path inside runner or injected secret)
     - DEV_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH
   - For local development, use ephemeral keys generated by:
     python -c "from src.infra.keys import generate_rsa_keypair; generate_rsa_keypair('.secrets/dev_rsa.pem','.secrets/dev_rsa.pub', overwrite=True)"

2. Manifest integrity:
   - The baseline manifest (data/baselines/manifest.json) includes SHA256 hashes and must be verified at runtime.
   - Any change to the baseline requires creating a new manifest and signing it.

3. Audit trail:
   - All gating decisions produce JSON receipts and are signed.
   - Receipts must be append-only; CI tests assert the audit log integrity.

4. Reporting:
   - If you find a security vulnerability, open a private issue titled SECURITY and notify the repository admin.
